Back in the USSR

Flew in from Miami Beach, BOAC,
didn't get to bed last night.
On the way the paper bag was on my knee,
man I had a dreadful flight.

I'm back in the USSR,
You don't know how lucky you are, boys.
Back in the USSR.

Been away so long I hardly knew the place,
Gee it's good to be back home.
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case,
Honey, disconnect the phone.

I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the US,
Back in the US,
Back in the USSR
